<h1>Zombies: The Movie</h1>
<p  style='text-align: center;'> ❦
</p>
<div class='wrapper' style='text-align:left; ' >
<p><span class='smallcaps'>Fade in</span> around a serious-looking group of uniformed military officers. At the head of the table, a senior, heavy-set man, <span class='smallcaps'>General Fred</span>, speaks.
</p>
<p><span class='smallcaps'>General Fred:</span> The reports are confirmed. New York has been overrun… by <em>zombies</em>.
</p>
<p><span class='smallcaps'>Colonel Todd:</span> Again? But we just had a zombie invasion 28 days ago!
</p>
<p><span class='smallcaps'>General Fred:</span> These zombies… are different. They’re… <em>philosophical</em> zombies.
</p>
<p><span class='smallcaps'>Captain Mudd:</span> Are they filled with rage, causing them to bite people?
</p>
<p><span class='smallcaps'>Colonel Todd:</span> Do they lose all capacity for reason?
</p>
<p><span class='smallcaps'>General Fred:</span> No. They behave… <em>exactly</em> like we do… except that they’re not conscious.
</p>
<p><em>(Silence grips the table.)</em>
</p>
<p><span class='smallcaps'>Colonel Todd:</span> Dear God.
</p>
<p><span class='smallcaps'>General Fred</span> moves over to a computerized display.
</p>
<p><span class='smallcaps'>General Fred:</span> This is New York City, two weeks ago.
</p>
<p>The display shows crowds bustling through the streets, people eating in restaurants, a garbage truck hauling away trash.
</p>
<p><span class='smallcaps'>General Fred:</span> <em>This</em>... is New York City... <em>now</em>.
</p>
<p>The display changes, showing a crowded subway train, a group of students laughing in a park, and a couple holding hands in the sunlight.
</p>
<p><span class='smallcaps'>Colonel Todd:</span> It’s worse than I imagined.
</p>
<p><span class='smallcaps'>Captain Mudd:</span> How can you tell, exactly?
</p>
<p><span class='smallcaps'>Colonel Todd:</span> I’ve never seen anything so brutally ordinary.
</p>
<p  style='padding-left: 0;'> A lab-coated <span class='smallcaps'>Scientist</span> stands up at the foot of the table.
</p>
<p><span class='smallcaps'>Scientist:</span> The zombie disease eliminates consciousness without changing the brain in any way. We’ve been trying to understand how the disease is transmitted. Our conclusion is that, since the disease attacks dual properties of ordinary matter, it must, itself, operate outside our universe. We’re dealing with an <em>epiphenomenal virus</em>.
</p>
<p><span class='smallcaps'>General Fred:</span> Are you sure?
</p>
<p><span class='smallcaps'>Scientist:</span> As sure as we can be in the total absence of evidence.
</p>
<p><span class='smallcaps'>General Fred:</span> All right. Compile a report on every epiphenomenon ever observed. What, where, and who. I want a list of everything that hasn’t happened in the last fifty years.
</p>
<p><span class='smallcaps'>Captain Mudd:</span> If the virus is epiphenomenal, how do we know it exists?
</p>
<p><span class='smallcaps'>Scientist:</span> The same way we know we’re conscious.
</p>
<p><span class='smallcaps'>Captain Mudd:</span> Oh, okay.
</p>
<p><span class='smallcaps'>General Fred:</span> Have the doctors made any progress on finding an epiphenomenal cure?
</p>
<p><span class='smallcaps'>Scientist:</span> They’ve tried every placebo in the book. No dice. Everything they do has an effect.
</p>
<p><span class='smallcaps'>General Fred:</span> Have you brought in a homeopath?
</p>
<p><span class='smallcaps'>Scientist:</span> I tried, sir! I couldn’t find any!
</p>
<p><span class='smallcaps'>General Fred:</span> Excellent. And the Taoists?
</p>
<p><span class='smallcaps'>Scientist:</span> They refuse to do anything!
</p>
<p><span class='smallcaps'>General Fred:</span> Then we may yet be saved.
</p>
<p><span class='smallcaps'>Colonel Todd:</span> What about David Chalmers? Shouldn’t he be here?
</p>
<p><span class='smallcaps'>General Fred:</span> Chalmers… was one of the first victims.
</p>
<p><span class='smallcaps'>Colonel Todd:</span> Oh no.
</p>
<p>(<em>Cut</em> to the <span class='smallcaps'>interior</span> of a cell, completely walled in by reinforced glass, where <span class='smallcaps'>David Chalmers</span> paces back and forth.)
</p>
<p><span class='smallcaps'>Doctor:</span> David! David Chalmers! Can you hear me?
</p>
<p><span class='smallcaps'>Chalmers:</span> Yes.
</p>
<p><span class='smallcaps'>Nurse:</span> It’s no use, doctor.
</p>
<p><span class='smallcaps'>Chalmers:</span> I’m perfectly fine. I’ve been introspecting on my consciousness, and I can’t detect any difference. I <em>know</em> I would be expected to say that, but—
</p>
<p>The <span class='smallcaps'>Doctor</span> turns away from the glass screen in horror.
</p>
<p><span class='smallcaps'>Doctor:</span> His words, they… they <em>don’t mean anything</em>.
</p>
<p><span class='smallcaps'>Chalmers:</span> This is a grotesque distortion of my philosophical views. This sort of thing can’t actually happen!
</p>
<p><span class='smallcaps'>Doctor:</span> Why not?
</p>
<p><span class='smallcaps'>Nurse:</span> Yes, why not?
</p>
<p><span class='smallcaps'>Chalmers:</span> Because—
</p>
<p>(Cut to two <span class='smallcaps'>Police Officers</span>, guarding a dirt road leading up to the imposing steel gate of a gigantic concrete complex. On their uniforms, a badge reads <span class='smallcaps'>Bridging Law Enforcement Agency</span>.)
</p>
<p><span class='smallcaps'>Officer 1:</span> You’ve got to watch out for those clever bastards. They look like humans. They can talk like humans. They’re identical to humans on the atomic level. But they’re not human.
</p>
<p><span class='smallcaps'>Officer 2:</span> Scumbags.
</p>
<p>The huge noise of a throbbing engine echoes over the hills. Up rides the <span class='smallcaps'>Man</span> on a white motorcycle. The <span class='smallcaps'>Man</span> is wearing black sunglasses and a black leather business suit with a black leather tie and silver metal boots. His white beard flows in the wind. He pulls to a halt in front of the gate.
</p>
<p>The <span class='smallcaps'>Officers</span> bustle up to the motorcycle.
</p>
<p><span class='smallcaps'>Officer 1:</span> State your business here.
</p>
<p><span class='smallcaps'>Man:</span> Is this where you’re keeping David Chalmers?
</p>
<p><span class='smallcaps'>Officer 2:</span> What’s it to you? You a friend of his?
</p>
<p><span class='smallcaps'>Man:</span> Can’t say I am. But even zombies have rights.
</p>
<p><span class='smallcaps'>Officer 1:</span> All right, buddy, let’s see your qualia.
</p>
<p><span class='smallcaps'>Man:</span> I don’t have any.
</p>
<p><span class='smallcaps'>Officer 2</span> suddenly pulls a gun, keeping it trained on the <span class='smallcaps'>Man</span>.
</p>
<p><span class='smallcaps'>Officer 2:</span> Aha! A zombie!
</p>
<p><span class='smallcaps'>Officer 1:</span> No, zombies claim to have qualia.
</p>
<p><span class='smallcaps'>Officer 2:</span> So he’s an ordinary human?
</p>
<p><span class='smallcaps'>Officer 1:</span> No, they also claim to have qualia.
</p>
<p>The <span class='smallcaps'>Officers</span> look at the <span class='smallcaps'>Man</span>, who waits calmly.
</p>
<p><span class='smallcaps'>Officer 2:</span> Um…
</p>
<p><span class='smallcaps'>Officer 1:</span> Who <em>are</em> you?
</p>
<p><span class='smallcaps'>Man:</span> I’m Daniel Dennett, bitches.
</p>
<p>Seemingly from nowhere, <span class='smallcaps'>Dennett</span> pulls a sword and slices <span class='smallcaps'>Officer 2</span>’s gun in half with a steely noise. <span class='smallcaps'>Officer 1</span> begins to reach for his own gun, but <span class='smallcaps'>Dennett</span> is suddenly standing behind <span class='smallcaps'>Officer 1</span> and chops with a fist, striking the junction of <span class='smallcaps'>Officer 1</span>’s shoulder and neck. <span class='smallcaps'>Officer 1</span> drops to the ground.
</p>
<p><span class='smallcaps'>Officer 2</span> steps back, horrified.
</p>
<p><span class='smallcaps'>Officer 2:</span> That’s not possible! How’d you do that?
</p>
<p><span class='smallcaps'>Dennett:</span> I am one with my body.
</p>
<p><span class='smallcaps'>Dennett</span> drops <span class='smallcaps'>Officer 2</span> with another blow, and strides toward the gate.
</p>
<p>He looks up at the imposing concrete complex, and grips his sword tighter.
</p>
<p><span class='smallcaps'>Dennett</span> <em>(quietly to himself)</em>: There is a spoon.
</p>
<p>(Cut back to <span class='smallcaps'>General Fred</span> and the other military officials.)
</p>
<p><span class='smallcaps'>General Fred:</span> I’ve just received the reports. We’ve lost Detroit.
</p>
<p><span class='smallcaps'>Captain Mudd:</span> I don’t want to be the one to say “Good riddance,” but—
</p>
<p><span class='smallcaps'>General Fred:</span> Australia has been… <em>reduced to atoms</em>.
</p>
<p><span class='smallcaps'>Colonel Todd:</span> The epiphenomenal virus is spreading faster. Civilization itself threatens to dissolve into total normality. We could be looking at the middle of humanity.
</p>
<p><span class='smallcaps'>Captain Mudd:</span> Can we negotiate with the zombies?
</p>
<p><span class='smallcaps'>General Fred:</span> We’ve sent them messages. They sent only a single reply.
</p>
<p><span class='smallcaps'>Captain Mudd:</span> Which was…?
</p>
<p><span class='smallcaps'>General Fred:</span> It’s on its way now.
</p>
<p>An orderly brings in an envelope, and hands it to <span class='smallcaps'>General Fred</span>.
</p>
<p><span class='smallcaps'>General Fred</span> opens the envelope, takes out a single sheet of paper, and reads it.
</p>
<p>Silence envelops the room.
</p>
<p><span class='smallcaps'>Captain Mudd:</span> What’s it say?
</p>
<p><span class='smallcaps'>General Fred:</span> It says… that we’re the ones with the virus. (A silence falls.)
</p>
<p><span class='smallcaps'>Colonel Todd</span> raises his hands and stares at them.
</p>
<p><span class='smallcaps'>Colonel Todd:</span> My God, it’s true. It’s true. I…
</p>
<p>(A tear rolls down <span class='smallcaps'>Colonel Todd</span>’s cheek.)
</p>
<p><span class='smallcaps'>Colonel Todd:</span> I don’t feel anything.
</p>
<p>The screen goes black.
</p>
<p>The sound goes silent.
</p>
<p>The movie continues exactly as before.
